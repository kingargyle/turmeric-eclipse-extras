This is a set of plugins that enhance the existing functionality of the 
TURMERIC SOA platform.  These features may eventually make it back into
the core, but are provided here for experimentation first.

To build these plugins you need to use Maven 3.  Once you have maven 3
installed you can build the plugin and update site:

mvn clean install

The update site will be available in the com.github.turmeric.eclipse.extras.repository/target/site
directory.  You can point your eclipse installation to this directory to
install the new software.   Once installed, you will have a XML Catalog 
entry added to the XML preferences.  This contains the namespace and xml
schemas to be used when files are loaded into the XML editor.
